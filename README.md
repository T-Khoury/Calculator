# Calculator
This is a calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JS as part of The Odin Project curriculum.  I learned and applied how to create and use objects, manipulate the DOM, use event listeners, as well as learned CSS grid to make the layout.  

The calculator has a DEL(backspace) function, a clear everything function, and handles floating point arthimetic as well.  The functionality of the calculator has been mostly based off of the Microsoft Windows Calculator.
